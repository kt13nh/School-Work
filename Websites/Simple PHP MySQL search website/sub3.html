            Musician, singer, songwriter and actor <strong>Ringo Starr was born Richard
            Starkey on July 7, 1940, in Liverpool, England</strong>. Known for his
            easy-going personality, Starr first rose to fame in the early
            1960s as the drummer for the legendary rock group the Beatles.
            He grew up poor in Liverpool, and his father left the family when 
            Starr was only three. A sickly child, he missed a lot of school on
            account of his illnesses. Starr eventually dropped out as a teenager.

            Starr met the members of another Liverpool group, the Beatles, 
            while both groups were playing in Hamburg, Germany, in 1960. 
            <strong>Two years later, he was asked to join the Beatles to replace their
            current drummer Pete Best</strong>. Starr was soon on the fast track to
            success with his new bandmates<strong> Paul McCartney, John Lennon and
            George Harrison</strong>.With their floppy hair and matching suits,
            the Beatles crossed the Atlantic Ocean to launch their own pop
            invasion of America in 1964. Beatlemania was in full force during
            their first U.S. television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.
            Their single,<strong><em> "I Want to Hold Your Hand,"</em></strong> had already climbed to 
            the top of the charts before the taping and was followed by a 
            succession of hits. And throngs of screaming fans - many of which 
            were love - struck teenagers - filled the audiences of their live shows.

            In 1966, the Beatles stopped touring, giving their last concert in
            August at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. They continued to record
            together, taking their music in new directions. They created one of
            rock's first concept albums with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
            Band (1967), which was meant to be listened to in its entirety. 
            Other commercial and critical successes, included<strong> The Beatles 
            (often referred to as The White Album) (1968), to which Starr
            contributed the track "Don't Pass Me By."</strong>

            After the Beatles broke up in 1970, <strong>Starr pursued a solo career.
            </strong>
            His first album, Sentimental Journey (1970), was a collection of 
            Tin Pan Alley tunes. For his next effort, Starr went for country
            with Beaucoup of Blues (1971). Starr found his greatest solo
            success with Ringo (1973), which featured such hits as<strong> "It Don't
                Come Easy," "Photograph," and "You're Sixteen."</strong>
            <p></p>

            Starr has been married twice. Wed to Maureen Cox from 1965 to 1975,
            the couple had three children together, <strong>Zak, Jason and Lee</strong>. Zak has
            followed in his father's footsteps and become an accomplished 
            drummer in his right, playing with such bands as The Who and Oasis.
            Starr and his friend Keith Moon, the original drummer for The Who,
            had encouraged his interest from an early age. <strong>Starr and his second
                wife Barbara Bach have been married since 1981.</strong>
