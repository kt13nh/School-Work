            Pop star, songwriter, recording artist and producer<strong> George Harrison
            was born on February 25, 1943, in Liverpool, England</strong>. The youngest 
            of Harold and Louise French Harrison's four children, George played 
            lead guitar and sometimes sang lead vocals for the Beatles.

            As Harrison would later describe it, he had an "epiphany" of sorts
            at the age 12 or 13 while riding a bike around his neighborhood and 
            getting his first whiff of <strong>Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel"
            </strong>
            , which
            was playing from a nearby house. By the age of 14, Harrison, whose
            early rock heroes included Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Buddy 
            Holly, had purchased his first guitar and taught himself a few 
            chords.

            Impressed with his younger friend's talents, <strong>Paul McCartney</strong>
            , who
            had recently joined up with another Liverpool teenager, John Lennon,
            in a skiffle group known as the Quarrymen, invited Harrison to see
            the band perform. Harrison and Lennon actually shared some common 
            history. Both had attended Dovedale Primary School, but oddly had 
            never met. Their paths finally crossed in early 1958. McCartney had
            been pushing the 17-year-old Lennon to let the 14-year-old Harrison 
            join the band, but Lennon was reluctant to let the youngster team up
            with them. As legend has it, after seeing McCartney and Lennon 
            perform, George was finally granted an audition on the upper deck 
            of a bus, where he wowed Lennon with his rendition of popular
            American rock riffs.

            <strong>In 1974, his marriage to Pattie Boyd</strong>, whom he'd 
            married eight years
            before.<strong>In 1978, Harrison, newly married to Olivia Arias</strong>
            and the
             father of a young son, Dhani, returned to the studio to record his
             eighth solo album, George Harrison, which was released the
             following year. It was followed two years later with Somewhere in
             England, which was still being worked on at the time of
             <strong>John Lennon's assassination on December 8, 1980</strong>.

            But a comeback of sorts arrived in 1987, with the release of his
            album Cloud Nine. The record featured a pair of hits and led to
            Harrison linking up with Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and 
            Bob Dylan to form what was dubbed a "super group" in the form of 
            the Traveling Wilburys. Encouraged by the commercial success of the
            Wilburys two studio albums, <strong>Harrison took to the road in 1992, 
                embarking on his first solo tour in 18 years.</strong>

            Still, the ensuing years were not completely stress-free.<strong> In 1998,
            Harrison, a longtime smoker, reportedly was successfully treated
            for throat cancer</strong>. A year later, his life was again put on the line
            when a deranged 33-year-old Beatles fan somehow managed to 
            circumvent Harrison's intricate security system and detail and
            broke into his home, attacking the musician and his wife, Olivia, 
            with a knife. Harrison was treated for a collapsed lung and minor 
            stab wounds. Olivia suffered several cuts and bruises.In May 2001,
            Harrison's cancer returned. There was lung surgery, but doctors
            soon discovered the cancer had spread to his brain. That autumn
            he traveled to the United States for treatment and eventually
            landed at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.<strong> He died on 
            November 29, 2001, at a friend's house in LA with his wife and
            son at his side</strong>.
