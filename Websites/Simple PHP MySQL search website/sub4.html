            <strong>Sir James Paul McCartney was born on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool,
            England, to Mary and James McCartney</strong>. His mother was a maternity
            nurse, and his father a cotton salesman and jazz pianist with a 
            local band. The young McCartney was raised in a traditional 
            working-class family, much the same as his future fellow Beatles
            Ringo Starr and George Harrison. Tragically, when McCartney was 
            only 14 years old, his mother died of complications after a 
            mastectomy. His future bandmate, <strong>John Lennon</strong>, also lost his mother
            at a young ageâ€”a connection that McCartney would later point to
            as the start of a close bond between the two musicians."

            Encouraged by his father to try out multiple musical instruments,
            Paul McCartney began his lifelong love affair with music at an 
            early age. Though he took formal music lessons as a boy, the 
            future star preferred to learn by ear, teaching himself the 
            Spanish guitar, trumpet and piano. <strong>In 1957, the teenaged musician
            met John Lennon at a church festival where both young men were
            performing</strong>. Sensing an early affinity, McCartney joined Lennon's
            band, the Quarrymen. The two quickly became the group's songwriters,
            ushering it through many name changes and a few personnel changes 
            as well.

            By 1960, the group had settled on a new moniker, the Beatles, and 
            George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best rounded out the 
            group. The soon-to-be legendary "mod squad" started out in the 
            1960s in Hamburg, Germany, spending two years playing various
            nightclubs there. <strong>Sutcliffe soon left the band</strong>, leaving McCartney
            to pick up the slack as the group's bass player. While in Hamburg,
            the Beatles recorded their first tracks, garnering the attention
            of Brian Epstein, who quickly signed on as the band's manager. 
            It wasn't long before the Beatles headed back to their home country 
            and began working their way into the popular consciousness there.
            And <strong>Best's replacement by drummer Ringo Starr</strong> only helped the group
            gain steam.

            <strong>In 1966, the Beatles stopped touring</strong>, giving their last concert in
            August at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. They continued to record
            together, taking their music in new directions. They created one of
            rock's first concept albums with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
            Band (1967), which was meant to be listened to in its entirety. 
            Other commercial and critical successes, included The Beatles 
            (often referred to as The White Album) (1968), to which Starr
            contributed the track <strong>"Don't Pass Me By."</strong>

            <strong>The Beatles disbanded in 1970</strong>, breaking fans' hearts worldwide. 
            However, McCartney had no intention of dropping out of the public
            eye. <strong>He was the first of the Beatles to release a solo album 
                (McCartney, 1970)</strong>, and though critics' reactions were mixed, 
            the album was a hit with the public. Encouraged, McCartney went
            on to form Wings, a band that would remain popular throughout
            the '70s, winning two Grammy Awards and churning out multiple
            hit singles.

            <strong>Tragedy struck in 1998, when McCartney's wife of 29 years, Linda
            McCartney, died after a long battle with cancer</strong>. Four years later,
            the musician married Heather Mills, a former model and 
            anti-landmine activist. They welcomed a daughter, Beatrice
            , in 2003. Amid much press scrutiny and intense animosity,
            McCartney and Mills parted ways in 2006. <strong>He married for the 
            third time, to New York businesswoman Nancy Shevell, in October
            2011, in London.</strong>
