            <strong>Pete Best's mother, Mona Best</strong> (born Alice Mona Shaw), was born in
            <strong>Delhi, India</strong>, and was the daughter of Thomas (an Irish major) 
            and Mary Shaw. Randolph Peter Scanland
            (later surnamed Best), her first child, was born in <strong>Madras</strong>
            (now Chennai), <strong>Madras Presidency</strong>, British India, on 24 November 
            1941. Pete's biological father was marine engineer Donald Peter
            Scanland, who subsequently died during World War II. Mona was 
            training to become a doctor in the service of the <strong>Red Cross</strong> when
            she met Johnny Best, who came from a family of sports promoters in
            Liverpool that ran <strong>Liverpool Stadium</strong>.During World War II, 
            he was a commissioned officer serving as a <strong>Physical Training
                Instructor</strong> in India, and was the Army's middleweight boxing 
            champion. After their marriage on 7 March 1944 at St. Thomas's 
            Cathedral, Bombay, Rory Best (Pete's younger brother) was born. 
            In 1945, the Best family sailed for four weeks to Liverpool on the
            Georgic, the last troop ship to leave India, carrying single and 
            married soldiers who had previously been a part of <strong>General Sir 
                William Slim's</strong> forces in south-east Asia. The ship docked in
            <strong>Liverpool on 25 December 1945</strong>.

        <h2>Stuart Sutcliffe</h2>
        <br><br><br>

        <p >
            <strong>Sutcliffe's</strong> playing style was elementary,
            mostly sticking to <strong>root
                notes</strong> of chords. <strong>Harry-an art</strong>
                school friend and founder and
            editor of the Mersey Beat newspaper-complained to Sutcliffe that
            he should be concentrating on art and not music, as he thought
            that Sutcliffe was a competent musician whose talents would be 
            better used in the visual arts. While Sutcliffe is often
            described in Beatles' biographies as appearing very uncomfortable 
            onstage, and often playing with his back to the audience, their
            drummer at the time, Best, denies this, recalling Sutcliffe as 
            usually good-natured and "animated" before an audience. When
            the Beatles auditioned for Larry Parnes at the Wyvern Club, Seel
            Street, Liverpool, Williams later claimed that Parnes would have 
            taken the group as the backing band for Billy Fury for 10 per
            week, but as Sutcliffe turned his back to Parnes throughout the 
            auditionâ€”because, as Williams believed, Sutcliffe could not play
            very well-Parnes said that he would only employ the group if 
            they got rid of Sutcliffe. Parnes later denied this, stating his
            only concern was that the group had no permanent drummer.
            <strong>Klaus Voormann regarded Sutcliffe</strong> as a good bass player, 
            although<strong> Beatles' historian Richie Unterberger</strong>
            described 
            Sutcliffe's bass playing as an "artless thump"
