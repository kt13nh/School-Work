            It all began in <strong><em>1957, Liverpool England</em></strong>, the second most unlikely 
            place in the world to give birth to stardom (the first being 
            Demorest, Georgia). <strong><em>John Lennon</em></strong>
                had learned the banjo at a young 
            age, moving quickly to the guitar and then starting his own band. 
            Dubbed <strong><em>"The Quarry Men"</em></strong>, this high school skiffle group played 
            around Liverpool, changing members more frequently than they 
            changed socks. Soon, a young <strong><em>Mr. Paul McCartney</em></strong> sauntered up to 
            John in between concerts. After hearing him play the guitar, John 
            said "Hey. Join me band, we'll become the most popular group in the
            world." Not wanting to appear anxious, Paul waited a day before 
            saying "Alright, sure." The famous<strong><em> Lennon-McCartney</em></strong> duo was born. 
            
        </p> 
        
        <p> 
            Eight months later Paul had a suggestion for a new recruit. Three
            years their junior, <strong><em>George Harrison</em></strong> was
            nonetheless a wizard on the
            guitar. <strong><em>John</em></strong> was hesitant to allow such a
            young person into the
            band, but <strong><em>George</em></strong> won him over. Two weeks before his 15th birthday,
            <strong><em>George</em></strong> officially became a member of the band.
            I don't know about
            you, but my fifteenth birthday wasn't nearly as productive as his.

            <strong><em>The Beatles</em></strong> did not immediately jump out
            to stardom. In fact, their
            climb was somewhat like a roller coaster, a slow clanking to the
            top, the suspense building and waiting for that first plunge over
            the hill. For months they toured <strong>Liverpool</strong> and the surrounding
            towns trying to build a fan base. Eventually they made their way
            Hamburg, playing to a particularly rowdy crowd. The boys were
            forced to rev-up their performance for the demanding audience,
            teaching them how to become true showmen. Upon returning to
            Liverpool, they discovered some of their fame had preceded them.

            <strong>Brian Epstein</strong>, a record store owner in Liverpool,
            got wind of <strong><em>The
            Beatles</em></strong> about this time. His interest was piqued, so he went to
            watch them perform one night. At first glance, they appeared like 
            most young Liverpudlians at the time: uncouth hair, leather jackets
            and dark trousers. But when they played, their synthesis created
            something marvelous. Something about their energy when together
            inspired Brian to become their manager. He pulled some strings and
            got the boys a few auditions. Sadly, they were unfruitful. This 
            didn't dampen their resolve, however, and Epstein continued lobbying
            for the band until he finally secured an audition with<strong> George Martin
                at Parlophone records.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            
            Martin, as it turns out, loved their sound. He, too, was an early
            victim of the Beatles' undeniable charm and catchy beats, succumbing
            to their charismatic energy like Bugs Bunny to a carrot. He cleaned
            them up, put them in tailored suits and gave them a resounding 
            thumbs-up (It was Brian Epstein who suggested they wear suits).
            The only part of the package he didn't seem to like was their 
            drummer, <strong><em>Pete Best</em></strong>. In a move that still raises eyebrows to this
            day, Epstein was asked to replace Pete before the deal would be 
            complete. <strong><em>Richard Starkey, our beloved Ringo Starr
                </em></strong>, would take
            his place, completing the rock and roll quartet. <strong>The Beatles were
            complete</strong>.
