            Famed singer-songwriter<strong> John Winston Lennon was born on October 9,
                1940, in Liverpool, Merseyside, England</strong>, during a German air raid
            in World War II.

            When he was 4 years old, Lennon's parents separated and he ended up
            living with his Aunt Mimi. Lennon's father was a merchant seaman. 
            He was not present at his son's birth and did not see a lot of his
            son when he was small.

            <strong>Elvis Presley's</strong> explosion onto the rock music scene inspired a
            16-year-old Lennon to create the skiffle band called the Quarry Men,
            named after his school. Lennon met Paul McCartney at a church fete
            on July 6, 1957. He soon invited McCartney to join the group, and 
            the two eventually formed one of the most successful songwriting 
            partnerships in musical history.

            Lennon married Cynthia Powell in August 1962. The couple had one 
            son together, Julian, who was named after Lennon's mother. Cynthia 
            was forced to keep a very low profile during<strong> Beatlemania</strong>. She and
            Lennon divorced in 1968. He remarried the following year, on March
            20, 1969, to Japanese avant-garde artist <strong>Yoko Ono</strong>, whom he had met
            at the Indica Gallery in November 1966.

            Not long after the Beatles broke up, in 1970, Lennon released his 
            debut solo album, <strong>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</strong>, featuring a raw,
            minimalist sound that followed "primal-scream" therapy. He followed 
            that project with 1971's Imagine, the most commercially successful
            and critically acclaimed of all Lennon's post-Beatles efforts. The 
            title track was later named No. 3 on Rolling Stone magazine's "
            All-Time Best Songs" list.

            In 1980, John Lennon returned to the music world with the album 
            <strong>Double Fantasy</strong>, featuring the hit single "(Just Like) Starting Over.
            " Tragically, just a few weeks after the album's release, Lennon was
            shot several times by a deranged fan in front of his apartment 
            complex in New York City. Lennon died at New York City's Roosevelt
            Hospital on December 8, 1980, at the age of 40.

            John Lennon's assassination had, and continues to have, a profound
            impact on pop culture. Following the tragic event, millions of fans
            worldwide mourned as record sales soared. And Lennon's untimely 
            death still evokes deep sadness around the globe today, as he 
            continues to be admired by new generations of fans. Lennon was 
            posthumously inducted into the <strong>Songwriters Hall of Fame
                in 1987</strong>,
            and the <strong>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994</strong>.
