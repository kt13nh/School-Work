            Chirashizushi is a bowl of sushi rice topped with a variety of raw
            fish and vegetables/garnishes (also refers to barazushi). There is 
            no set formula for the ingredients; they are either chef's choice 
            or specified by the customer

        <ul>
            <li>
                Makizushi, norimaki or makimono is a cylindrical piece, formed
                with the help of a bamboo mat known as a makisu. Makizushi
                is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally
                wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso 
                (perilla) leaves. Makizushi is usually cut into six or eight
                pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some
                common types of makizushi, but many other kinds exist.

            Narezushi
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Narezushi is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and
                gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel,
                doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy 
                tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out
                and is removed. After six months, this sushi can be eaten,
                remaining edible for another six months or more. The most
                famous variety of narezushi still being produced is funa-zushi
                (made from fish of the crucian carp genus, authentically from C.
                auratus grandoculis (nigoro-buna) endemic to Lake Biwa), 
                a typical dish of Shiga Prefecture.

        </h2>
        <h3>
            Sushi-meshi
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sushi-meshi is a preparation of white,</strong> short-grained, Japanese rice 
            mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and
            occasionally kombu and sake. It has to be cooled to room temperature
            before being used for a filling in a sushi or else it will get too
            sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a
            hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a
            wooden paddle
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="id1">
            Nori
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The black seaweed wrappers used in makimono</strong>
                are called nori.
            Nori is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors
            of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, 
            rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in
            a process similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial 
            product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Neta
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons,</strong>
                the minimum
            quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to 
            that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to
            recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness,
            and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial 
            inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), 
            Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), 
            mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient
            is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of otoro
            (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chÅ«toro, meaning "middle
            toro", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro 
            and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the 
            fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri
            sushi will have completely raw neta.

            Condiments
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments.</strong>
                Sushi may be dipped in 
            shoyu, soy sauce, and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant
            paste made from the grated root of the Wasabia japonica plant. 
            Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon,
            pork and other sushi cuts.

            Health Benefits
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The main ingredients of traditional</strong>
                Japanese sushi, raw fish
                and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, 
                carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, 
                as are gari and nori. Other vegetables wrapped within the 
                sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the 
                seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which
                have a variety of health benefits.

            Health Risks
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Some of the ingredients in sushi </strong>can present health risks. 
                Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin)
                can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to
                mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or
                when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including 
                women who might get pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers 
                and young children.
